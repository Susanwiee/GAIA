#Optional: If another building type than "school is preeffered, please define:
accessability_building_type="school"

#Optional: If Another building type than "apartment" and "office" is preffered for serviceavailability, please define:

# 7) analyse the geospatial data you provided to check that all elements are included 
#( ! if there are missing hight values, go to "modify_heights.py" for further instructions !)

########## GIS #########
# For visualization: enter feature as one of the following
# "Buildings"           # Residential, public, office, industrial, etc.
#"BuildingsModified"   # Buildings that include a 'height' attribute           
#"Services"            # Caf√©s, restaurants, shops, pharmacies, etc.
#"Nature"              # Parks, water bodies, forests, grass, gardens, etc.
#"Barriers"            # Highways, railways, fences, etc.
#"Cycle"               # Cycleways and bike infrastructure
#"CycleWithBuffer"     # Same as above, but with buffer zones for visibility
#"Sites"               # Plots/sites of potential development
#"SpecificBuildings"   # Highlight specific buildings by ID
#"SitesAndShadows"     # Plots + shadows from hypothetical buildings
#"All"                 # Everything (buildings, barriers, nature, cycleways, etc.)
